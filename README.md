## TwitchIO Console Chat

This is a program using TwitchIO to output chat into the terminal.

I wrote this for me, but you're welcome to use it for whatever you'd like!


## to use
1) Do this
```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirments.txt
```
2) change sample-config.py to config.py, and fill it in where appropriate.

3) From your venv
```sh
python3 chat.py
```
4) enjoy!
